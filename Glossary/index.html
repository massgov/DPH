  <p> <dfn>Age-standardized Rate</dfn> &ndash; (ASR) A summary measure of a rate that a population would have if it had a standard age structure (for example, the age distribution of the U.S. Census population). Standardization is necessary when comparing several populations that differ with respect to age because age has a powerful influence on the risk of many diseases. </p>
  <p> <a name="12" id="12"></a><dfn>Air </dfn> &ndash; &quot;Pure&quot; air is a mixture of gases containing about 78 percent nitrogen; 21 percent oxygen; less than 1 percent of <a href="index.html#50">carbon dioxide</a>, argon, and other gases; and varying amounts of water vapor [compare with <a href="index.html#24">Ambient Air</a>]. </p>
  <p> <a name="14" id="14"></a><a name="13" id="13"></a><dfn>Airborne Release </dfn> &ndash; Release of any pollutant into the air. </p>

  <p> <a name="18" id="18"></a><dfn>Air Pollution </dfn> &ndash; The presence of <a href="index.html#17">air pollutants</a> in the air.</p>
  <p> <a name="19" id="19"></a><dfn>Air Pollution Episode </dfn> &ndash; A period of abnormally high concentration of air pollutants, often due to low winds and temperature inversion, which can cause illness and death.</p>
  <p> <a name="20" id="20"></a><dfn>Air Quality Criteria </dfn> &ndash; The levels of pollution and lengths of exposure above which adverse health and welfare effects may occur.</p>
  <p> <a name="21" id="21"></a><dfn>Air Quality Index (AQI) </dfn> &ndash; A numerical index developed by the U.S. EPA for reporting the severity of daily air pollution levels to the public. U.S. EPA calculates an AQI for five air pollutants - ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. AQI levels range from 0 (good air quality) to 500 (hazardous air quality). The higher the index, the higher the level of pollutants and the greater the likelihood of health effects. The AQI incorporates an additional index category - unhealthy for sensitive groups - that ranges from 101 to 150.</p>
  <p> <a name="22" id="22"></a><dfn>Air Quality Standards </dfn> &ndash; The level of <a href="index.html#177">pollutants</a> prescribed by regulations that are not be exceeded during a given time in a defined area.</p>

Also known as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).</p>
  <p> <a name="24" id="24"></a><dfn>Ambient Air </dfn> &ndash; Any unconfined portion of the atmosphere: open air, surrounding air.</p>
  <p> <a name="25" id="25"></a><dfn>Ambient Measurement</dfn> &ndash; A measurement of the concentration of a substance or pollutant within the immediate <a href="index.html#95">environment</a> of an individual; a measurement taken to relate it to the amount of possible <a href="index.html#105">exposure</a>.</p>
  <p> <a name="26" id="26"></a><dfn>Anaerobic</dfn> &ndash; Requiring the absence of oxygen [compare with <a href="index.html#8">Aerobic</a>].</p>
  <p> <a name="27" id="27"></a><dfn>Analyte</dfn> &ndash; A chemical for which a sample (such as water, air, or blood) is tested in a laboratory. For example, if the analyte is mercury, the laboratory test will determine the amount of mercury in the sample.</p>
  <p> <a name="28" id="28"></a><dfn>Analytic Epidemiologic Study</dfn> &ndash; A study that evaluates the association between exposure to hazardous substances and disease by testing scientific hypotheses.</p>

  <p> <a name="Cancer" id="Cancer"></a><dfn>Cancer</dfn> &ndash; Any one of a group of diseases that occur when cells in the body become abnormal and grow or multiply out of control. Cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and can spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems. There are several main types of cancer. Carcinoma is cancer that begins in the skin or in tissues that line or cover internal organs. Sarcoma is cancer that begins in bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue. Leukemia is cancer that starts in blood-forming tissue such as the bone marrow, and causes large numbers of abnormal blood cells to be produced and enter the blood. Lymphoma and multiple myeloma are cancers that begin in the cells of the immune system. Central nervous system cancers are cancers that begin in the tissues of the brain and spinal cord.</p>
  <p> <a name="47" id="47"></a><dfn>Cancer Cluster </dfn> &ndash; Because cancer is a common disease, it often appears to occur in &ldquo;clusters,&rdquo; and it is understandable that someone may perceive that there are an unusually high number of cancer cases in their surrounding neighborhood or community. A suspected cluster is more likely to be a true cancer cluster if it involves a large number of cases of one type of cancer diagnosed in a relatively short time period rather than several different types diagnosed over a long period of time (i.e., 20 years), a rare type of cancer rather than a common type, and a large number of cases diagnosed among individuals in age groups not usually affected by that cancer. </p>

The disorder is more common in premature infants born about 6 weeks or more before their due dates. RDS is more common in premature infants because their lungs aren't able to make enough surfactant. Surfactant is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so that infants can breathe in air once they're born. Without enough surfactant, the lungs collapse and the infant has to work hard to breathe. He or she might not be able to breathe in enough oxygen to support the body's organs. The lack of oxygen can damage the baby's brain and other organs if proper treatment isn't given.</p>

  <p> <a name="216" id="216"></a><dfn>Standardization</dfn> &ndash; Data standardization is the process of statistically adjusting data from two or more populations so that they may be compared to understand differences between the populations.</p>
  <p> <a name="217" id="217"></a><dfn>Standardized Incidence Ratio</dfn> &ndash; (SIR) An SIR is the ratio of the observed number of cancer diagnoses in an area to the expected number of diagnoses multiplied by 100. Age-specific statewide incidence rates are applied to the population distribution of a community to calculate the number of expected cancer diagnoses. The SIR is a comparison of the number of diagnoses in the specific area (i.e., community or census tract) to the number of expected diagnoses based on the statewide rate. Comparison of SIRs between communities or census tracts is not possible because these areas have different population characteristics (including age distributions). </p>

  <p><dfn>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)</dfn> &ndash; Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death, usually during sleep, of a seemingly healthy baby. Sudden infant death syndrome is sometimes called crib death. The exact cause is unknown, but SIDS may be associated with abnormalities in the portion of an infant's brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep. Although all babies are vulnerable, certain sleep environments have been linked to increased risk. Perhaps the most important way to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome is to place your baby on his or her back to sleep, on a firm crib mattress covered by a fitted sheet. Nothing else should go in the crib with your baby ? no blanket, pillow, bumper pads or toys. </p>
