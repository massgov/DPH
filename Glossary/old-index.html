                      <a name="Cancer" id="Cancer"></a><strong>Cancer</strong> - Any one of a group of diseases that occur when cells in the body become  abnormal and grow or multiply out of control. Cancer cells can invade nearby  tissues and can spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph  systems. There are several main types of cancer. Carcinoma is cancer that  begins in the skin or in tissues that line or cover internal organs. Sarcoma is  cancer that begins in bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other  connective or supportive tissue. Leukemia is cancer that starts in  blood-forming tissue such as the bone marrow, and causes large numbers of  abnormal blood cells to be produced and enter the blood. Lymphoma and multiple  myeloma are cancers that begin in the cells of the immune system. Central  nervous system cancers are cancers that begin in the tissues of the brain and  spinal cord.</p>

A suspected cluster is more likely to be a true  cancer cluster if it involves a large number of cases of one type of cancer  diagnosed in a relatively short time period rather than several different types  diagnosed over a long period of time (i.e., 20 years), a rare type of cancer  rather than a common type, and a large number of cases diagnosed among  individuals in age groups not usually affected by that cancer.&nbsp;</p>

The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of  settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being  maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from  census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by  highway construction, new development, etc., may require occasional revisions;  census tracts occasionally are split due to large population growth, or  combined as a result of substantial population decline.

Plaque buildup and the narrowing and hardening of the arteries is  called atherosclerosis. Plaque is a mixture of fatty substances including  cholesterol and other lipids. Blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart can be  reduced or even fully blocked with a growing plaque. Plaque may also rupture  and cause blood clots that block arteries.

The  presence of TTHM and HAA5 is representative of the occurrence of many other  chlorination DBPs; thus, a reduction in the TTHM and HAA5 generally indicates a  reduction of DBPs from chlorination. DBPs in drinking water can change from day  to day, depending on the season, water temperature, amount of disinfectant  added, the amount of plant material in the water, and a variety of other  factors.</p>

The water system must prove that (1) even while using the best available  treatment method it cannot meet a Maximum Contaminant Level because of the  characteristics of the raw water and (2) the variance will not create an  unreasonable risk to public health. The state or U.S. EPA must review and allow  public comment on a variance every three years. States can also grant variances  to water systems that serve small populations and which prove that they are  unable to afford the required treatment or an alternative water source or to  otherwise comply with the standard.</p>

  <a name="198" id="198"></a><strong>Respiratory </strong>- Relating to or affecting breathing or the organs used  to breathe.</p>
  <p><strong>Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS)</strong> - Respiratory distress  syndrome (RDS) is a breathing disorder that affects newborns. The disorder is  more common in premature infants born about 6 weeks or more before their due  dates.&nbsp; RDS is more common in premature  infants because their lungs aren't able to make enough surfactant. Surfactant  is a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs. It helps keep them open so that  infants can breathe in air once they're born.&nbsp;  Without enough surfactant, the lungs collapse and the infant has to work  hard to breathe. He or she might not be able to breathe in enough oxygen to  support the body's organs. The lack of oxygen can damage the baby's brain and  other organs if proper treatment isn't given.</p>

                      <p><strong>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)</strong> - Sudden  infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death, usually during sleep, of  a seemingly healthy baby. Sudden infant death syndrome is sometimes called crib  death. The exact cause is unknown, but SIDS may be associated with  abnormalities in the portion of an infant's brain that controls breathing and  arousal from sleep. Although all babies are vulnerable, certain sleep  environments have been linked to increased risk. Perhaps the most important way  to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome is to place your baby on his  or her back to sleep, on a firm crib mattress covered by a fitted sheet.  Nothing else should go in the crib with your baby &mdash; no blanket, pillow, bumper  pads or toys. </p>

Releases of oil and/or hazardous materials are reported to the MassDEP Bureau  of Waste Site Cleanup (BWSC), according to procedures established in the  Massachusetts Contingency Plan (310 CMR 40.0000). A site&rsquo;s Tier Classification  determines the level of MassDEP oversight. The classification scheme is based  on the disposal site's complexity, the type of contamination, and the potential  for human or environmental exposure to the contamination. Some sites are  automatically classified as Tier 1 sites if they pose an imminent hazard,  affect public water supplies, or miss regulatory deadlines. The MassDEP Tier  Classified Oil and/or Hazardous Material Sites data layer, accessible when  calculating cancer rates, is a statewide point dataset containing the  approximate location of disposal sites that have been tier classified under the  MCP; sites that have not yet been tier classified are not contained in this  data layer.
