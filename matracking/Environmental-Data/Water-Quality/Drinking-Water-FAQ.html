<h3><a name="Ars" id="Ars"></a>Arsenic</h3>

<h4>What is arsenic?</h4>
<p>
  Arsenic is a metal that occurs naturally in the Earth&rsquo;s crust in soil, rocks, and minerals. 
</p>

<h4>How can arsenic get  in drinking water?</h4>
<p>
  Arsenic is a byproduct of some agricultural and industrial activities. It also occurs naturally. It can enter drinking water through the ground or as run-off into surface water sources.
</p>

<h4>Why is arsenic in  drinking water an important public health issue?</h4>
<p>
Some people who drink water  containing arsenic in excess of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA)  Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) over many years could experience skin damage or  problems with their circulatory system and may have an increased risk of  getting cancer. 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, these health effects may include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thickening and discoloration of the skin, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and liver effects; </li>
  <li>Cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunological, neurological (e.g., numbness and partial paralysis), reproductive, and endocrine (e.g., diabetes) effects; </li>
  <li>Cancer of the bladder, lungs, skin, kidney, nasal passages, liver, and prostate. </li>
</ul>

<h4>What is a community water system?</h4>
<p>
A community  water system is a type of public water system.  The other type of public water system is a non-community water system. While all public water systems have at least 15 service  connections or serve at least 25 people per day for 60 days of the year, community  water systems serve the same people year round and non-community systems do not  serve the same people year round.
</p>

<h4>What is a &ldquo;Maximum Contaminant Level&rdquo;?</h4>
<p>
Community water systems are  required to provide drinking water that meets standards established under the  Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA establishes  drinking water standards for individual contaminants and groups of contaminants.  In establishing an MCL, EPA evaluates  studies on health effects (toxicology and epidemiology), studies on the  occurrence of the contaminant in water, and studies on the effectiveness and  cost of treatment available to remove the contaminant. Based on analysis of this information, EPA  sets an MCL.
</p>
<p>
MCLs  apply to all community water systems. However, the associated monitoring  requirements may vary for a contaminant   or contaminant group based on the type of source water and on the results of  previous samples. Regulations and state drinking water agencies specify  sample location and acceptable analytical methods.  Surface water  systems typically monitor more frequently than groundwater systems because the  occurrence of contaminants is more variable over time. Systems that do  not detect contaminants or detect them only at very low levels compared to the  MCL monitor less frequently. Monitoring may also vary based on service  population size and water treatment used.
</p>
<p>
Drinking water standards and  monitoring requirements are not static. New  regulations are developed for previously unregulated contaminants. Also, EPA must periodically review and, if  necessary, revise existing regulations based on new information on health  effects, treatment, analytical methods, and contaminant occurrence.
</p>

<h4>What are the monitoring requirements for  arsenic?</h4>
<p>
All community water systems are  required to monitor for arsenic at the entry-point to the distribution system;  however, the frequency of monitoring varies based on source water type and the  level of arsenic observed in past samples. Routine required monitoring is  annual for surface water and once every 3 years for ground water, with  quarterly monitoring once a sample exceeds 10 parts per billion (ppb). With  a state granted monitoring waiver, the sampling frequency can be reduced to  once every 9 years.
</p>
<p>
In 2006, the EPA lowered the  MCL for arsenic from 50 ppb to 10 ppb  (also  shown as 10 ug/L).
</p>

<h4>Are there monitoring requirements for arsenic  in private wells?</h4>
<p>
Local Boards of Health (BOH) have  primary jurisdiction over the regulation of private wells. The local BOH is  empowered to adopt a private well regulation that establishes criteria for  private well siting, construction, water quality, and quantity.
</p>
<p>
Private well drinking water quality  is not included as part of the Massachusetts Environmental Public Health  Tracking Program. Residents who obtain water from  private wells may obtain additional information from the Massachusetts  Department of Environmental Protection by clicking <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/water/drinking/lookup-by-location.html">here</a>. 
</p>

<h4>Why is the Massachusetts Department of Public Health  tracking arsenic in drinking water?</h4>
<p>
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established nationally consistent environmental and health  data measures (NCDM) for the environmental and health tracking network. Arsenic is an NCDM. Linking  data on arsenic concentrations in  drinking water with health data will provide specific information to the  general public and policy makers on the degree to which arsenic contamination  may be contributing to adverse health impacts in communities throughout the  state.
</p>
      
<h3><a name="Atr" id="Atr"></a>Atrazine</h3>

<h4>What is atrazine? </h4>
<p>
Atrazine is a white, crystalline solid organic compound. It is used in  the agricultural industry as an herbicide.
</p>

<h4>How can atrazine get in drinking water?</h4>
<p>
Atrazine is sprayed on crops to prevent broadleaf and grassy weeds. It  can wash off the soil into streams and groundwater, contaminating well water in  nearby areas.
</p>

<h4>Why is atrazine in drinking water an  important public health issue?</h4>
<p>
Some people who drink water containing atrazine in excess of the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) over  many years could experience problems with their cardiovascular and reproductive  systems.
</p>

<h4>What is a community water system?</h4>
<p>
A community water system is a type of public water system. The  other type of public water system is a non-community water system. While  all public water systems have at least 15 service connections or serve at least  25 people per day for 60 days of the year, community water systems serve the  same people year round and non-community systems do not serve the same people  year round.
</p>

<h4>What is a &ldquo;Maximum Contaminant Level&rdquo;?</h4>
<p>
Community water systems are required to provide drinking water that meets  standards established under the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA establishes  drinking water standards for individual contaminants and groups of  contaminants. In establishing an MCL, EPA evaluates studies on health  effects (toxicology and epidemiology), studies on the occurrence of the  contaminant in water, and studies on the effectiveness and cost of treatment  available to remove the contaminant. Based on analysis of this information,  EPA sets an MCL.
</p>
<p>
MCLs  apply to all community water systems. However, the associated monitoring  requirements may vary for a contaminant   or contaminant group based on the type of source water and on the results of  previous samples. Regulations and state drinking water agencies specify  sample location and acceptable analytical methods. Surface water  systems typically monitor more frequently than groundwater systems because the  occurrence of contaminants is more variable over time. Systems that do  not detect contaminants or detect them only at very low levels compared to the  MCL monitor less frequently. Monitoring may also vary based on service  population size and water treatment used.
</p>
<p>
Drinking water standards and monitoring requirements are not static.  New regulations are developed for previously unregulated contaminants.  Also, EPA must periodically review and, if necessary, revise existing regulations based on new information on health  effects, treatment, analytical methods, and contaminant occurrence.
</p>

<h4>What are the monitoring requirements for  atrazine?</h4>
<p>
In 2003, the EPA initiated a monitoring program for atrazine to focus on exposures  through drinking water. Because atrazine is a restricted use pesticide (RUP),  the EPA was able to identify where atrazine is used and select only those CWSs with  a potential for contamination to be included in the program. These include CWSs  that are served by surface water, because atrazine levels are higher in surface  water than in groundwater. The CWSs in the program are monitored weekly during  the peak-use season and biweekly during the rest of the year. Monitoring is  continued for at least 5 years. If a CWS does not exceed the limit during the 5  year period, it is released from the program. However, two exceedances in  different years within a 5 year period will result in prohibition of further  atrazine use. Water systems can also be added to the program based on data that  suggest that those particular systems may reach levels of concern. Because of  this, CWSs enter and exit the program on an ongoing basis and the number in the  program is different from year to year.
</p>
<p>
The MCL for atrazine is .003mg/L.
</p>

<h4>Are there monitoring requirements for  atrazine in private wells?</h4>
<p>
Local Boards of Health (BOH) have primary jurisdiction over the  regulation of private wells. The local BOH is empowered to adopt a private well  regulation that establishes criteria for private well siting, construction,  water quality and quantity.
</p>
<p>
Private well drinking water quality is not included as part of the  Massachusetts Environmental Public Health Tracking Program. Residents who  obtain water from private wells may obtain additional information from the  Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection by clicking <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/water/drinking/private-wells.html"> here</a>.
</p>

<h4>Why is the Massachusetts Department of Public  Health tracking atrazine in drinking water?</h4>
<p>
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) established nationally consistent environmental and health  data measures (NCDM) for the environmental and health tracking network. Atrazine is an NCDM. Linking data on atrazine concentrations in drinking water with health  data will provide specific information to the general public and policy makers  on the degree to which atrazine contamination may be contributing to adverse  health impacts in communities throughout the state.

<h3><a name="Deh" id="Deh"></a>Di(2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate (DEHP)</h3>

<h4>What is DEHP?</h4>
<p>
DEHP is a colorless  liquid that is used in manufacturing as a plasticizer. It is found in many  plastic products to make them flexible.
</p>

<h4>How can DEHP get in drinking water?</h4>
<p>
Rubber and chemical factories that use DEHP in the manufacturing process  can discharge DEHP into the surrounding area. Water systems near waste sites  can be contaminated with the discharged chemical.
</p>

<h4>Why is DEHP in drinking water an important  public health issue?</h4>
<p>
Some people who drink water containing DEHP in excess of the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) over many years could  experience complications in reproduction and problems with their liver.  Prolonged exposure may also increase the risk of developing cancer.
</p>

<h4>What is a community water system?</h4>
<p>
A community water system is a type of public water system. The  other type of public water system is a non-community water system.

Also, EPA must periodically review and, if necessary, revise existing regulations based on new information on health  effects, treatment, analytical methods, and contaminant occurrence.
</p>

<h4>What are the monitoring requirements for DEHP?</h4>
<p>
DEHP was added as a drinking water contaminant by the EPA in 1995.  Because of this, it is subject to all EPA drinking water standards as set by  the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1986. This law requires the EPA to determine  levels of contaminants at which no adverse health effects are expected to  occur. These levels are called the maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG), and  are not enforceable by the EPA. The maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) are  enforceable and set based upon the MCLGs. The EPA attempts to set MCLs that  are as close to the health goals as are feasible.
</p>
<p>
The MCLG for DEHP is zero and the MCL is .006mg/L. This MCL was set based  upon the best available science to prevent potential health problems associated  with exposure to DEHP. When routine monitoring, required at all water systems,  identifies levels of DEHP above the MCL, the water system must take steps to  reduce the level. The Public Notification Rule (PN) states that the water  provider must also notify their customers within 30 days of the violation and  may be required to take additional steps, such as providing an alternate source  of drinking water, when serious risk to the health of the public is present.  DEHP is also subject to the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) Program. The TRI  provides the public with information on releases of toxic chemicals in their  communities. These laws set by the EPA require facilities that use toxic  chemicals above specified amounts to report on disposal and release of the  chemical annually.

<h3><a name="Dis" id="Dis"></a>Disinfection Byproducts</h3>
<h4>What are disinfection  byproducts (DBPs) and how do they get in drinking water?</h4>
<p>
Public water may contain viruses  and bacteria that can causeillness, such as gastrointestinal disorders or  diarrhea. Public water suppliers disinfect their water to kill these  viruses and bacteria. Chlorine is the most  commonly used disinfectant. Sometimes it  is used in combination with other disinfectants,such asozone,  chloramine, chlorine dioxide, and ultraviolet light.
</p>
<p>
DBPs are a family of chemicals  formed when chlorine-based disinfectants react with naturally occurring organic  matter, such as acids from decaying leaves, and other substances in the source  water. The levels of DBPs depend upon  the nature of the source water, the type of treatment to remove particles and  organic matter, and the type and concentration of chlorine disinfection. 
</p>
<p>
DBPs include total trihalomethanes  (4 chemicals) and haloacetic acids (5 chemicals).
</p>

<h4>Why are DBPs in  drinking water an important public health issue?</h4>
<p>
When people consume disinfection  byproducts at levels exceeding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA)  Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) over many years, they increase their risk of  developing bladder cancer. Other health effects that may be associated  with exposure to DBPs include rectal and colon cancer. Adverse  developmental and reproductive effects associated with exposure to disinfection  byproducts during pregnancy are a concern. They have been  studiedwith mixed results; however, the weight of evidenceof the  health effects data suggests a potential association.
</p>

<h4>What is a community water system?</h4>
<p>
A community  water system is a type of public water system.  The other type of public water system is a non-community water  system. While all public water systems have at least 15 service  connections or serve at least 25 people per day for 60 days of the year,  community water systems serve the same people year round and non-community  systems do not serve the same people year round.

<h4>What are the monitoring requirements for DBPs?</h4>
<p>
All community water systems that  disinfect their water (i.e., all surface water and some groundwater systems)  are required to monitor for DBPs in the distribution system. Monitoring  requirements and the number of samples a system collects varies based on source  water type, chlorine treatment type, the number of treatment plants, historical  DBP levels, and the size of the population served. Typically, systems  with a single treatment plant monitor quarterly at four locations in the  distribution system and report the results of samples, quarterly averages, and  an annual running average.
</p>
<p>
Compliance is based on an annual  running average of total trihalomethanes at or below 80 parts per billion (ppb)  and haloacetic acids at or below 60 ppb.

<h3><a name="Lead" id="Lead"></a>Lead</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://pilot.mass.gov/service-details/sources-of-lead-besides-lead-paint" target="_blank">Click here to see the Lead in Drinking Water Factsheet.</a>
</p>

<h4>What is lead?</h4>
<p>		
Lead  is a naturally occurring bluish-gray metal found in small amounts in the  earth&rsquo;s crust. Lead can be found in all  parts of our environment. Much of it  comes from burning fossil fuels, mining, and manufacturing. 
</p>
<p>
Lead  has many different uses. It is used in  the production of batteries, ammunition, metal products (solder and pipes), and  devices to shield X-rays. It is also a  minor constituent in brass plumbing fixtures.  Because of health concerns, lead from paints and ceramic products,  caulking, and pipe solder has been dramatically reduced in recent years. The use of lead as an additive to gasoline in  the United States was phased out beginning in 1975.
</p>

<h4>How does lead get in  drinking water?</h4>
<p>
Typically, lead gets into your water after the water leaves your local treatment plant or  your well. That is, the source of lead  in your home's water is most likely from pipes or solder in your home's own  plumbing. The most common cause is  corrosion, a reaction between the water and the lead in the pipes or solder. Dissolved oxygen, low pH (acidity), and low  mineral content in water are common causes of corrosion.
</p>

<h4>Why is lead in  drinking water an important public health issue?</h4>
<p>
For  infants and children, exposure to high levels of lead in drinking water can  result in delays in physical or mental development. For adults, it can result in kidney problems  or high blood pressure. Although the main sources of exposure to lead are  ingesting paint chips and inhaling lead dust, U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) estimates that 10 to 20 percent of human exposure to lead may come  from lead in drinking water. Infants who  consume mostly mixed formula can receive 40 to 60 percent of their exposure to  lead from drinking water. The health  effects of lead are most severe for infants and children.
</p>

<h4>What is a community water system?</h4>
<p>
A community  water system is a type of public water system.  The other type of public water system is a non-community water  system. While all public water systems have at least 15 service  connections or serve at least 25 people per day for 60 days of the year,  community water systems serve the same people year round and non-community  systems do not serve the same people year round.
</p>

<h4>What is the Lead and  Copper Rule?</h4>
<p>
On  June 7, 1991, EPA published a regulation to control lead and copper in drinking  water. This regulation is known as the  Lead and Copper Rule (also referred to as the LCR or 1991 Rule).
</p>
<p>The  rule states that all community water systems are required to monitor for lead  in drinking water at customer&rsquo;s taps. The  number of samples required varies by the size of the population served by the  system. If lead concentrations exceed an  action level of 15 ppb in more than 10% of customer taps sampled, the system  must undertake a number of additional actions to control corrosion. The system must also inform the public about  steps they should take to protect their health and may have to replace lead  service lines under their control
</p>

<h4>Are there monitoring requirements for lead in  private wells?</h4>

<h3><a name="Nit" id="Nit"></a>Nitrates</h3>
<h4>What are nitrates?</h4>
<p>
Nitrates and nitrites are  nitrogen-oxygen molecules that occur naturally at low levels in water. Nitrate is the form commonly found in higher  levels in water, in areas where nitrogen-based fertilizers are used. Once taken into the body, nitrates are  converted into nitrites. Nitrates are  not normally dangerous to human health unless they are reduced to nitrites.
</p>

<h4>How do nitrates get  in drinking water?</h4>
<p>
Nitrate and nitrite can enter drinking  water sources from nitrate-containing fertilizers, sewage and septic tanks, and  decaying natural material such as human waste, livestock manure, and decaying  plants. Nitrate is very soluble in water  and moves easily through the soil.  Nitrates and nitrites are likely to remain in water until taken up by  plants or consumed by other organisms.
</p>

<h4>Why are nitrates in  drinking water an important public health issue?</h4>
<p>
High levels of nitrates in drinking water can cause serious illness and  sometimes death. Infants are particularly  prone to the effects of nitrate exposure because the body changes nitrates to  nitrites, and nitrites subsequently interfere with the oxygen-carrying capacity  of the child&rsquo;s blood by binding to hemoglobin.  This can be an acute condition in which health deteriorates rapidly over  a period of days. Symptoms include  shortness of breath and blueness of the skin.
</p>
<p>
Long term exposures to nitrates and nitrites above the  drinking water standard, or Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) have the potential  to cause frequent urination, increased starchy deposits in the kidneys, and  hemorrhaging of the spleen. Long term  exposures to nitrates may also cause adverse reproductive effects and some  cancers, but these associations are inconclusive at this time. Presently, health standards are focused on  protecting infants.
</p>

<h4>What is a community water system?</h4>

</p>

<h4>What are the monitoring requirements for  nitrates?</h4>
<p>
All public water systems are  required to monitor for nitrates at each entry-point to the distribution  system. However, the frequency of  monitoring varies based on source water type and the levels of nitrate and nitrite  observed in past samples. Required routine monitoring is annual for ground  water sources (or quarterly if a sample exceeds half the MCL) and quarterly for  surface water sources (or annual if 4 consecutive quarterly results for the  system are less than half of the MCL).
</p>
<p>
EPA has set MCL drinking water standards of 10  mg/L for total nitrate and nitrite; 10 mg/L for nitrate and 1 mg/L for nitrite.

Based on analysis of this  information, EPA sets an MCL.</p>
      <p>MCLs  apply to all community water systems. However, the associated monitoring  requirements may vary for a contaminant or contaminant group based on the type  of source water and on the results of previous samples. Regulations and  state drinking water agencies specify sample location and acceptable analytical  methods.  Surface water systems typically monitor more frequently  than groundwater systems because the occurrence of contaminants is more  variable over time. Systems that do not detect contaminants or detect  them only at very low levels compared to the MCL monitor less frequently.  Monitoring may also vary based on service population size and water treatment  used.</p>
    <p>Drinking water standards and monitoring requirements are not static.  New regulations are developed for previously unregulated contaminants.  Also, EPA must periodically review and, if necessary, revise existing regulations based on new information on health  effects, treatment, analytical methods, and contaminant occurrence.
      <h3>What are the monitoring requirements for  radium?</h3>
      Radium is monitored only in community water systems. Because of the wide  variation in radium levels based on geographic location, levels may vary within  a water system. According to the Radionuclides Rule, established by the EPA in  2000, all water entering the distribution system must be tested. The MCL for  radium in drinking water is 5pCi/L. 
      <h3>Are there monitoring requirements for radium  in private wells?</h3>
      <p>Local Boards of Health (BOH) have primary jurisdiction over the regulation  of private wells. The local BOH is empowered to adopt a private well regulation  that establishes criteria for private well siting, construction, water quality,  and quantity.</p>
      <p> Private well drinking water quality is not included as part of the  Massachusetts Environmental Public Health Tracking Program. Residents who  obtain water from private wells may obtain additional information from the  Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection by clicking <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/agencies/massdep/water/drinking/private-wells.html"> here</a>.      
<h3>Why is the Massachusetts Department of Public  Health tracking radium in drinking water?</h3>
      The U.S. Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) established nationally consistent environmental and health  data measures (NCDM) for the environmental and health tracking network. Radium is an NCDM.Linking data on radium concentrations in drinking water with health data  will provide specific information to the general public and policy makers on  the degree to which radium contamination may be contributing to adverse health  impacts in communities throughout the state.</p>

<h3><a name="Tce" id="Tce"></a>Trichloroethene (Trichloroethylene) (TCE) </h3>
<h4>What is trichloroethene? </h4>
<p>
Tricholorethene is a colorless or blue liquid that is used in  metal-degreasing and in the production of textiles. 
</p>

<h4>How can trichloroethene get in drinking  water?</h4>
<p>
Tricholorethene is introduced to drinking water sources through waste and  discharge from factories where it is used.
</p>

<h4>Why is trichloroethene in drinking water an  important public health issue?</h4>
<p>
Some people who drink water containing trichloroethene in excess of the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)  over many years could experience problems with their liver or an increased risk  of getting cancer.
</p>

<h4>What is a community water system?</h4>
<p>
A community water system is a type of public water system. The  other type of public water system is a non-community water system. While  all public water systems have at least 15 service connections or serve at least  25 people per day for 60 days of the year, community water systems serve the  same people year round and non-community systems do not serve the same people  year round.
</p>

<h4>What is a &ldquo;Maximum Contaminant Level&rdquo;?</h4>
<p>
Community water systems are required to provide drinking water that meets  standards established under the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA establishes  drinking water standards for individual contaminants and groups of  contaminants. In establishing an MCL, EPA evaluates studies on health  effects (toxicology and epidemiology), studies on the occurrence of the contaminant  in water, and studies on the effectiveness and cost of treatment available to  remove the contaminant. Based on analysis of this information, EPA sets  an MCL.
</p>
<p>
MCLs  apply to all community water systems. However, the associated monitoring  requirements may vary for a contaminant or contaminant group based on the type  of source water and on the results of previous samples. Regulations and  state drinking water agencies specify sample location and acceptable analytical  methods.  Surface water systems typically monitor more frequently  than groundwater systems because the occurrence of contaminants is more  variable over time. Systems that do not detect contaminants or detect  them only at very low levels compared to the MCL monitor less frequently.  Monitoring may also vary based on service population size and water treatment  used.
</p>
<p>
Drinking water standards and monitoring requirements are not static.  New regulations are developed for previously unregulated contaminants.  Also, EPA must periodically review and, if necessary, revise existing regulations based on new information on health  effects, treatment, analytical methods, and contaminant occurrence.
</p>

<h4>What are the monitoring requirements for trichloroethene?</h4>
<p>
The EPA recognizes TCE as a toxic contaminant of drinking water. Because  of this, it is subject to all EPA drinking water standards as set by the Safe  Drinking Water Act of 1986. This law requires the EPA to determine levels of  contaminants at which no adverse health effects are expected to occur. These  levels are called the maximum contaminant level goals (MCLG), and are not enforceable by the EPA. The maximum contaminant levels (MCL&rsquo;s) are enforceable  and set based upon the MCLG&rsquo;s. The EPA attempts to set MCL&rsquo;s that are as close  to the health goals as are feasible.
</p>
<p>
The MCLG for trichloroethene is zero and the MCL is .005mg/L. When  routine monitoring, required at all water systems, identifies levels of  trichloroethene above the MCL, the water system must take steps to reduce the  level. The Public Notification Rule (PN) states that the water provider must  also notify their customers within 30 days of the violation and may be required  to take additional steps, such as providing an alternate source of drinking  water, when serious risk to the health of the public is present. 
</p>

<h4>Are there monitoring requirements for  trichloroethene in private wells?</h4>
<p>
Local Boards of Health (BOH) have primary jurisdiction over the  regulation of private wells. The local BOH is empowered to adopt a private well  regulation that establishes criteria for private well siting, construction,  water quality, and quantity.
</p>

<h3><a name="Ura" id="Ura"></a>Uranium</h3>
<h4>What is uranium? </h4>
<p>
  Uranium is a  naturally-occurring radioactive metal that is found naturally in the  environment. 
</p>

<h4>How can uranium get in drinking water?</h4>
<p>
Uranium occurs at naturally high levels in certain geographic locations  in the US.  In these locations, uranium contaminates groundwater that is surrounded by  affected rock and soil. 
</p>

<h4>Why is uranium in drinking water an important  public health issue?</h4>
<p>
People who drink water containing uranium in excess of the U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) over  many years will experience increased exposure to radiation, which may lead to  certain types of cancer.
</p>
