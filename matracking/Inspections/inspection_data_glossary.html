<h3>Addendum – Full Inspection:</h3>
<p>
	An addendum full inspection is done by a licensed lead inspector when the original comprehensive initial inspection report is no longer available, or if the inspector is no longer licensed and/or did not retain the records as required. An addendum full inspection can be done as a comprehensive initial inspection if the original report exists but pre-dates 2003 and an up-to-date report is needed to document changes in paint condition/lead hazards so that an accurate deleading plan can be generated. 
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Hazards found – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>No hazards found</li>
</ul>

<h3>Addendum to Previous Inspection:</h3>
<p>
	This is an abbreviated inspection conducted to document missed surfaces in a prior comprehensive initial inspection or changes in a home’s configuration, such as an addition or basement conversion. 
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Hazards found – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>No hazards found</li>
</ul>

<h3>Certificate of Maintained Compliance:</h3>
<p>
	A unit that has received a compliance letter in the past may be re-inspected to ensure that it has remained in compliance with the Lead Law (homes in compliance often fall out of compliance over time).  To certify maintained compliance, a post compliance assessment determination (PCAD) is performed provided the original inspection report and deleading paperwork, where applicable, is available. If this original paperwork is not available, then the lead inspector must perform a comprehensive initial inspection acting as a PCAD. If the PCAD does not reveal any new lead hazards or signs of unauthorized deleading, then a Certificate of Maintained Compliance is issued along with the original compliance letter. If lead hazards are found, then they must be remediated and the unit must pass a final 30 day maintenance reinspection before a Certificate of Maintained Compliance is issued.
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Issued</li>
	<li>Not Issued – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>Rescinded – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Certificate of Maintained Interim Control:</h3>
<p>
	A unit that has received a Letter of Interim Control may be re-inspected during its duration to ensure that it has remained in compliance with the Interim Control requirements (homes under Interim Control can fall out of compliance if lead paint becomes chipping or peeling or coverings are damaged).  To certify maintained interim control, a post compliance assessment determination (PCAD) of interim control is performed. If the PCAD does not reveal any new urgent lead hazards or signs of unauthorized deleading, then a Certificate of Maintained Interim Control is issued along with the original Letter of Interim Control. If urgent lead hazards are found, then they must be remediated and the unit must pass a final 30 day maintenance reinspection before a Certificate of Maintained Interim Control is issued.
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Issued</li>
	<li>Not Issued – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Certificate of Restored Compliance:</h3>
<p>
	 A unit that has received a compliance letter in the past may be assessed to ensure that it has remained in compliance with the Lead Law (homes in compliance can fall out of compliance over time).  A post compliance assessment determination (PCAD) is performed provided the original inspection report and deleading paperwork, where applicable, is available. If this original paperwork is not available, then the lead inspector must perform a comprehensive initial inspection acting as a PCAD. If this PCAD reveals hazards that are not corrected within the 30 day grace period, all lead hazards must be corrected by appropriately authorized people. At the final deleading reinspection, the deleading work is reinspected for completeness and established workmanship standards. The unit must be visually clean and dust wipes must pass. The Certificate of Restored Compliance is issued as an addendum to the original letter of compliance.
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Issued</li>
	<li>Not issued – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>Rescinded – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Certificate of Restored Interim Control:</h3>
<p>
	 A unit that has received a Letter of Interim Control may be re-inspected during its duration to ensure that it has remained in compliance with the Interim Control requirements (homes in compliance can fall out of compliance if leaded paint becomes chipping or peeling or coverings get damaged).  To certify maintained interim control, a post compliance assessment determination (PCAD) of interim control is performed. If this PCAD reveals urgent lead hazards that are not corrected within the 30 day grace period, all urgent lead hazards must be corrected by appropriately authorized people. At the final deleading reinspection, the deleading work is reinspected for completeness and established workmanship standards. The unit must be visually clean and dust wipes must pass. The Certificate of Restored Interim Control is issued as an addendum to the original letter of Interim Control.
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Issued</li>
	<li>Not Received – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Comprehensive Initial Inspection:</h3>
<p>
	This is the first step in determining whether or not your home has lead hazards. A comprehensive initial inspection is required by regulation when a child under the age of 6 is lead poisoned, or may be requested voluntarily by a parent, regardless of a child’s blood lead level. It is conducted by a licensed lead inspector and includes the interior of the unit or home, the common areas (hallways, laundry room), and the exterior of the building. This inspection will also include any outbuildings and structures on the lot (garages, fences).
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Completed – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>Hazards found – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>No hazards found</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contact CLPPP for Guidance</h3>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Flagged for Compliance Evaluation</li>
	<li>Flagged for Possible Fraud</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Triage Paperwork Errors Identified:</h3>
<p>
	 Inspectors are required to report copies of compliance documents, inspection report cover pages, and history pages to theCLPPP for review and entry into the database that populates this tracking portal and the LeadSafeHomes registry. Before CLPPP enters any data, the documents are reviewed for errors or omissions. When errors are identified, the data package is returned with a letter to both the owner and the inspector documenting deficiencies and requesting corrections and re-submission to CLPPP.
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Returned – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Determination:</h3>
<p>
	A determination is an abbreviated inspection conducted by a private lead inspector licensed by the state, or a local board of health code enforcer. It is not a comprehensive initial inspection. Deleading work cannot be done based on a determination. In order for deleading work to take place, an inspector must return and complete the comprehensive initial inspection report. 
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Hazards found</li>
	<li>No hazards found – Full inspection recommended</li>
	<li>Needs Full Inspection</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final 30 Day Maintenance Reinspection: </h3>
<p>
	A reinspection done by a licensed lead inspector within 30 days of a Post Compliance Assessment Determination (PCAD) to determine if the maintenance of lead hazards has been done correctly. The unit must be visually clean and dust samples must pass.

</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Failed – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>Passed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Deleading Reinspection: </h3>
<p>
	This is a reinspection done by a licensed lead inspector after deleading work has been conducted. If the reinspection finds that the work was done properly and completely by authorized people following established workmanship standards and the unit is visually clean and dust wipes pass, then a letter of full deleading compliance will be issued.
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Failed – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>Passed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Interim Control Recertification Reinspection: </h3>
<p>
	This is a reinspection that is done to make sure urgent lead hazards are deleaded and structural repairs are made. The deleading work is reinspected for completeness and established workmanship standards. The unit must be visually clean and dust samples must pass. 
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Passed</li>
	<li>Failed – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>

<h3>Issuance of Environmental Status Paperwork: </h3>
<p>
	The regulations for Lead Poisoning Prevention and Control require that in order for a Letter of Compliance to be issued, the owner must provide documentation of authorized work. Therefore, in homes where there is physical evidence of deleading but the owner cannot substantiate that the work was done by authorized people; the owner will not be eligible for a regular letter of compliance. In instances where the owner did not do the unauthorized work, but purchased the property in said condition, or where a contractor misrepresented himself as authorized to perform deleading, a Documentation of Environmental Status (DES) Letter is issued. This letter documents that all identified lead hazards were corrected, the unit was visually clean at reinspection, and passing dust wipes were achieved. It is acceptable for a child under the age of 6 to live in a residence with a DES letter and CLPPP encourages housing subsidy programs to accept these documents. CLPPP does not condone unauthorized deleading and owners who knowingly conduct unauthorized deleading will not be eligible for a Letter of Compliance or a DES Letter.  CLPPP reserves the right to seek fines and penalties against owners who perform unauthorized deleading.

<h3>Letter of Full Deleading Compliance: </h3>
<p>
	A letter of full deleading compliance is issued after authorized deleading work has been conducted and a licensed lead inspector verifies the work was conducted appropriately during a final deleading reinspection. The deleading work is inspected for completeness and established workmanship standards. The unit must be visually clean and dust samples must pass. Massachusetts does not have a lead-free standard. This letter means that as of the issuance date there were no lead hazards present. Owners must maintain the unit in order for the compliance letter to remain valid.
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Issued</li>
	<li>Not issued – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>Rescinded – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Letter of Full Initial Inspection Compliance:  </h3>
<p>
	A letter of full initial inspection compliance is issued after a comprehensive initial inspection is conducted and there are no lead hazards present. The inspection must also show that there were no signs of unauthorized deleading present. Massachusetts does NOT have a lead-free standard. This letter means that as of the issuance date there were no lead hazards present. Owners must maintain the unit in order for the compliance letter to remain valid.
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Issued</li>
	<li>Rescinded – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Letter of Interim Control: </h3>
<p>
	After a comprehensive initial inspection and risk assessment are completed, a letter of interim control may be issued to a property if a) lead hazards found were not considered urgent, or b) urgent lead hazards were identified and then corrected by appropriately authorized individuals. Any structural repairs that may cause damage to lead painted surfaces such as a leaking roof must also be repaired. Any deleading work is reinspected for completeness and established workmanship standards. The unit must be visually clean and dust samples must pass. The letter of interim control is a form of temporary compliance. It is valid for 1 year but can be renewed for a second year. 
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Issued</li>
	<li>Rescinded – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>PCAD of Interim Control: </h3>
<p>
	A visual inspection of a unit done by a licensed risk assessor to determine if a home remains under interim control (homes under interim control can fall out of compliance if lead paint becomes chipping or peeling or coverings are damaged).  
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>No Urgent Lead Hazards</li>
	<li>Urgent Lead Hazards – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Post Compliance Assessment Determination (PCAD): </h3>
<p>
	A visual inspection of a unit done by a licensed lead inspector to determine if a home remains in compliance with the Lead Law (homes in compliance often fall out of compliance over time).  In order to do a PCAD, the inspector must have the original documents issued for the home, including the comprehensive initial inspection report and/or the final deleading reinspection and compliance letter. If the original documents are missing, then the inspector must perform a comprehensive initial inspection functioning as a PCAD.
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Hazards found – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>No Hazards found</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recertification of Interim Control: </h3>
<p>
	After a letter of interim control is issued, it is only valid for 1 year unless a recertification of interim control is conducted. The recertification is good for 1 additional year and expires 2 years from the original letter of interim control issuance date. A recertification reinspection is conducted. If urgent lead hazards are identified, they must be corrected by appropriately authorized individuals. Any structural repairs that may cause damage to lead painted surfaces must be repaired (leaking roof). The deleading work is reinspected for completeness and established workmanship standards. The unit must be visually clean and dust samples must pass. 
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Issued</li>
	<li>Rescinded – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reinspection:  </h3>
<p>
	A reinspection is done by a licensed lead inspector to check on the progress of deleading work. 
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Work in Progress</li>
	<li>Passed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reoccupancy Reinspection: </h3>
<p>
	This is a type of reinspection done by a licensed lead inspector that allows a family to move back into a home after high and/or moderate risk deleading work done inside the unit is complete. At a re-occupancy re-inspection the inspector ensures that: (1) the work that took place was done by appropriately authorized people, (2) established workmanship standards were met, (3) there is no loose leaded paint inside the unit, (4) the unit is visually clean, and (5) dust wipes have passed. This re-inspection does not mean there are no lead hazards inside the unit nor does it mean that the unit is in compliance with the Lead Law. 
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Failed – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>Issued</li>
	<li>Passed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risk Assessment: </h3>
<p>
	If lead hazards are found during a comprehensive initial inspection, a risk assessment of the property may be conducted by a licensed risk assessor to gauge the severity of the lead hazards in order to qualify for a letter of interim control. The risk assessor will determine if the existing lead hazards qualify as urgent lead hazards, such as loose lead paint, and will also determine if there are structural defects present that are causing urgent lead hazards. A risk assessment includes the interior of the unit or home, the common areas (hallways, laundry room), and the exterior of the building. The assessment will also include any outbuildings and structures on the lot (garages, fences).
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>No urgent lead hazards</li>
	<li>Urgent lead hazards – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risk Assessment Interim Control Recertification: </h3>
<p>
	After a letter of interim control is issued, it is valid for 1 year unless a recertification of interim control is conducted. The recertification is good for 1 additional year and expires 2 years from the original letter of interim control issuance date. To get this recertification for the 2nd year, a risk assessment of interim control recertification is conducted by a licensed risk assessor to make sure that the home is still under interim control and that there are no new urgent lead hazards, such as loose lead paint or structural defects causing urgent lead hazards. This includes the interior of the unit or home, the common areas (hallways, laundry room), and the exterior of the building. The assessment will also include any outbuildings and structures on the lot (garages, fences). 
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Hazards Found – Contact CLPPP for more information</li>
	<li>No Hazards Found</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risk Assessment Reinspection: </h3>
<p>
	A risk assessment reinspection is done by a licensed risk assessor to check on the progress of deleading work and structural repairs for interim control.
</p>

<h4>Outcomes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>In progress</li>
</ul>
